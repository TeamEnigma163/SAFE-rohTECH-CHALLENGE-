Accident images will be fed as input to the machine learning model developed. It is developed considering 5 main causes of accidents â€“
1.	Crashes at junctions due to driver negligence
2.	Foggy weather
3.	No seat belt 
4.	Potholes
5.	Rain
A CNN image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras is developed in order to predict the major cause of the accident. It is deployed locally using Streamlit host. The images corresponding to each cause of the accident in the dataset were collected from the internet.
